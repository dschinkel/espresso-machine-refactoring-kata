espresso machine refactoring kata
=================================

We have a virtual espresso machine expressed in one big messy module called EspressMachine.

#### Your job is to perform the following in this order
**write tests around the messy legacy code**
 - write integration tests around the EspressoMachine module so that you can start to refactor with at least some degree of safety

**refactor Espressomachine** using [SOLID Principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)
- add new features to the virtual espresso machine
