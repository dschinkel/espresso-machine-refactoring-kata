In this kata we have hypothetical source code behind an espresso machine's touch based UI expressed in one big messy module called EspressMachine.

#### Your job is to perform the following in this order
1. **Write integration tests around the messy legacy code**
 - write integration tests around the EspressoMachine module so that you can start to refactor with at least some degree of safety

3. Add new features to extend the code that now adhere's to SOLID
