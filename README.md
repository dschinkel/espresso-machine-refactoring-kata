=================================
![Image of an espresso machine with UI](https://github.com/dschinkel/espresso-machine-refactoring-kata/blob/master/espresso-machine-with-ui.jpg)

In this kata we have hypothetical source code behind an espresso machine's touch based UI expressed in one **big messy module** called **EspressoMachine**.

*Your job is to perform the following in this order:*
1. **Write integration tests** around the messy legacy code to gain confidence before refactorin

    - If you're a beginner with tests #1 can be optional but still do #3 after you refactor and get to know TDD

2. **Refactor it** using [SOLID Principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)

3. **Add new features** via TDD to extend the code that now adhere's to SOLID
