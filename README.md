In this kata we have hypothetical source code behind an espresso machine's touch based UI expressed in one **big messy module** called **EspressoMachine**.

*Your job is to perform the following in this order:*
1. **Write integration tests** around the messy legacy code to gain confidence before refactorin

2. **Refactor it** using [SOLID Principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod)

3. **Add new features** via TDD to extend the code that now adhere's to SOLID
